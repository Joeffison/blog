  "#bio-literature-card": "I am fascinated by the written word. I have a lovely time reading poetry, but I feel like I can relate more to Portuguese and Brazilian works mostly for motives of culture and rhythm of our language.

  "#bio-investments-card": "Early in life, I was taught by dad (and life) to save for my future and I also saw men and women in my family having their own small businesses but I never had someone to teach me how to invest, so I now explore that by myself. However, my #1 dream is: be responsible for the creation of many jobs in a company people will be happy to work for."
